# HelloWorldPython3.py
# Demonstrates a simple publish to a topic using Greengrass core sdk
# This lambda function will retrieve underlying platform information and send
# a hello world message along with the platform information to the topic 'python3/hello/world'
# The function will sleep for five seconds, then repeat.  Since the function is
# long-lived it will run forever when deployed to a Greengrass core.  The handler
# will NOT be invoked in our example since the we are executing an infinite loop.
